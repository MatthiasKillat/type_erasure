# type_erasure
Demonstrates how to build heterogeneous containers via type erasure.

We want to create containers that are capable of storing different types that adhere to a given interface.

Regular polymorphism is only usable with pointers and references.

A heterogeneous container satisfies
1) Polymorphic behavior of stored types
2) Ownership of stored data
3) Copy and move semantics

To easily use it with new types is useful to also

4) not require the stored types to inherit from the interface

It is sufficient for the types to implement the interface to be useable in the container.

We show how to create the Any storage class using a specific type erasure techniques which combines templates with inheritance. The inhertitance is invisible to the user.

Given an interface, this Any class can be generated by a code generator (not implemented here).
